Scheduling Timeline
===================

This is a user-interface mockup for a content scheduling feature of a CMS, intended to allow a user to:

* Browse forward through "snapshots" of content scheduled to go live at particular times.
* Create and schedule new snapshots.

Updates are being pushed to [http://demo.robhoward.id.au/timeline/](http://demo.robhoward.id.au/timeline/) throughout the course of development.

This is currently not very usable, and not very working-when-viewed-with-IE. :)
